# Good Bad Movies

## About

- This is a web app developed to find the best bad movies ever made. If your like me, you enjoy art that doesn't take itself too seriously. We'll help you find your next bad movie by finding the worst half of existing movies and serving them to you.

## Building Blocks

- We use [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) on the frontend to deliver a seamless user experience using Javascript.

- Other Technologies used include: [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link/component-reactcomponent), [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#styling-any-component), [react-overdrive](https://github.com/berzniz/react-overdrive) ,and [dot-env](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

- The data is coming from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/discover).
